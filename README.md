# smartbrize-pumpkin-seed-flask
This project is a deep learning-based Pumpkin Seed classifier built using Flask. Users can upload images of pumpkin seeds, and the model predicts their type accurately. It combines AI, computer vision, and web deployment to provide an interactive and user-friendly seed classification tool.

Problem Statement
Manual classification of pumpkin seeds is time-consuming and error-prone.
This project automates the seed classification process using machine learning,
providing accurate and fast predictions through a web interface.

Solution Approach
- Collected pumpkin seed dataset
- Preprocessed data using scaling and encoding
- Trained a machine learning classification model
- Saved the trained model using pickle
- Deployed the model using Flask with a web UI

- Tech Stack
- Python
- Flask
- Machine Learning (Scikit-learn)
- HTML, CSS
- NumPy, Pandas

- Project Workflow
1. User enters pumpkin seed parameters
2. Input data is sent to Flask backend
3. Trained ML model processes the input
4. Prediction result is generated
5. Result is displayed on the web interface

6. Home Page (index.html)
7. ![seed](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be4b4edf-f6cd-429a-a3ef-21f3288546a0)

8. Input Form Filled

Output
- User inputs pumpkin seed parameters
- System predicts seed type
- Result is displayed on the web interface

- Future Enhancements
- Image-based pumpkin seed classification
- Cloud deployment
- Improved user interface
- Mobile responsive design
